    "# Tic Tac Toe Q-Learning Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains the implementation of a Q-Learning agent designed to learn how to play Tic Tac Toe effectively. By engaging in repeated games against a random opponent, the agent utilizes the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize its strategy over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the application of Q-Learning, a fundamental reinforcement learning technique, in a simple yet challenging environment. Tic Tac Toe serves as an ideal platform for understanding the dynamics of Q-Learning due to its straightforward rules and finite state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Q-Learning Agent**: Learns optimal moves by exploring the state space and adjusting its strategy based on the outcome of each game.\n",
    "- **Training**: The agent improves through self-play, adjusting its Q-values (expected utility of actions) based on rewards received for winning, losing, or drawing games.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexible Training**: Easily adjust the number of episodes for training to observe how the agent's performance evolves.\n",
    "- **State Management**: The agent learns to recognize different states of the Tic Tac Toe board and chooses actions accordingly.\n",
    "- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Balances between exploring new moves and exploiting known strategies to enhance learning.\n"
